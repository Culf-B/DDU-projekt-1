# Prototype for controlling the mouse using Leap Motion Controller 2
- Use python 3.8
- I don't know how to setup a venv correctly so to setup venv, run venvsetup.bat (you may need to modify name/path to python/pip to match your python 3.8 installation)
- You need the leapc python api https://github.com/ultraleap/leapc-python-bindings?tab=readme-ov-file (follow their install guide)
